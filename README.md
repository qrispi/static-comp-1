# Static Comp 1
The goal of this project was to re-create (liberties were given to assets, fonts, colors and text as nothing was provided) a basic HTML index page from a picture.

### I chose to recreate this image:

### Preview of my HTML re-creation:

### Technologies used:
- NPM installed icons from FlatIcon
- HTML
- CSS

### Wins & Challenges:
- Getting everything spaced out correctly was a huge challenge but learning how to properly use absolute positioning was a big win in that regard.
- I learned a lot of cool new things that I can do with CSS like creating my own checkmark inputs and how wrapping elements inside each other can be either a great tool or a great headache.
- This was my first time experimenting with true font icons and I really enjoyed learning about them and how they work with the rest of the page elements.

### Future Enhancements:
- I would really like to re-visit this and add some scaling and re-sizing features for multiple screen sizes. 
- I am also getting an error where my icons are not loading on github pages.
